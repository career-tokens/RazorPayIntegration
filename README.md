# RazorPayIntegration
This is a demo project where we will be simply completing a Razorpay payment for a predefined amount.
It is a MERN project where the backend server will be mainly used to supply api key, order details and verifying the payment and then redirect to payment successful page.
React will be mainly used to create beautiful and interactive UI. The application is responsive on all mobile applications.
MongoDB is used to save transactions(which are successful) for remembering the payments.
